# Product Requirements Document: IDS Integration

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements and implementation plan for integrating Ideographic Description Sequence (IDS) data from the CHISE IDS database into the Kiokun Dictionary application. This integration will enhance single Han character entries with composition information, allowing users to understand how characters are structured.

## Background
The CHISE IDS database provides detailed information about the composition of Han characters using Ideographic Description Sequences. This data is valuable for language learners to understand character structure and relationships between characters.

## Goals
1. Add IDS information to single Han character entries in the dictionary
2. Provide a clear visual representation of character composition in the UI
3. Ensure the integration is efficient and doesn't significantly increase dictionary size
4. Maintain compatibility with the existing dictionary structure and build process

## Non-Goals
1. Creating a full character composition editor
2. Supporting all possible IDS variants and extensions
3. Modifying the existing dictionary data structure significantly

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Download and store relevant IDS files from the CHISE IDS database
2. Parse IDS files and extract character composition information
3. Associate IDS data with corresponding single Han character entries
4. Display IDS information in the dictionary UI
5. Provide a visual representation of character composition

### Technical Requirements
1. Create a new dictionary type for IDS data
2. Implement an importer for IDS files
3. Modify the processor to enhance character entries with IDS data
4. Update the frontend to display IDS information
5. Add tests to verify the IDS integration

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Basic Integration
1. Create a new `ids` package in the `dictionaries` directory
2. Download relevant IDS files from CHISE and store them in the repository
3. Implement basic IDS parsing and data structures
4. Write tests for the IDS parser

### Phase 2: Dictionary Integration
1. Modify the dictionary processor to include IDS data in single Han character entries
2. Update the dictionary build process to include IDS data
3. Test the integration with a small subset of characters

### Phase 3: Frontend Integration
1. Update the frontend components to display IDS information
2. Implement a visual representation of character composition
3. Test the frontend integration

## Checklist

### Phase 1: Setup and Basic Integration
- [ ] Create `dictionaries/ids` directory structure
- [ ] Download IDS-UCS-Basic.txt and other relevant files
- [ ] Create `types.go` for IDS data structures
- [ ] Implement `importer.go` for parsing IDS files
- [ ] Create `init.go` to register the IDS dictionary
- [ ] Write tests for the IDS parser

### Phase 2: Dictionary Integration
- [ ] Modify `loader.go` to load IDS data
- [ ] Create a lookup map for quick access to IDS data
- [ ] Update the processor to add IDS data to single Han character entries
- [ ] Test the integration with a small subset of characters
- [ ] Measure the impact on dictionary size

### Phase 3: Frontend Integration
- [ ] Update `JishoEntryCard.tsx` to display IDS information
- [ ] Implement a visual representation of character composition
- [ ] Test the frontend integration with various characters
- [ ] Add documentation for the IDS feature

## Success Criteria
1. IDS data is correctly associated with single Han character entries
2. Character composition is clearly displayed in the UI
3. The integration doesn't significantly increase dictionary size or build time
4. All tests pass

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 1-2 days
- Phase 2: 1-2 days
- Phase 3: 1-2 days
- Total: 3-6 days

## Risks and Mitigations
1. **Risk**: IDS data might be incomplete or inconsistent
   **Mitigation**: Implement fallback mechanisms and handle missing data gracefully

2. **Risk**: Adding IDS data might significantly increase dictionary size
   **Mitigation**: Measure the impact and optimize if necessary

3. **Risk**: Parsing complex IDS expressions might be challenging
   **Mitigation**: Start with basic support and gradually add more complex features

4. **Risk**: Visual representation might be difficult to implement
   **Mitigation**: Start with a simple text-based representation and enhance it iteratively
